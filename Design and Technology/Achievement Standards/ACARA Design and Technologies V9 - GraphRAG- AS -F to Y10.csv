Technologies,Design and Technologies,Foundation,"By the end of Foundation students identify familiar products, services and environments. They create a designed solution for a school-selected context. Students create, communicate and choose design ideas. They follow steps and use materials and equipment to safely make a designed solution."
Technologies,Design and Technologies,Years 1–2,"By the end of Year 2 students describe the purpose of familiar products, services and environments. For each of the 2 prescribed technologies contexts they describe the features and uses of technologies and create designed solutions. Students select design ideas based on their personal preferences. They communicate design ideas using models and drawings and follow sequenced steps to safely produce designed solutions."
Technologies,Design and Technologies,Years 3–4,"By the end of Year 4 students describe how people design products, services and environments to meet the needs of people, including sustainability. For each of the 2 prescribed technologies contexts they describe the features and uses of technologies and create designed solutions. Students select design ideas against design criteria. They communicate design ideas using models and drawings including annotations and symbols. Students plan and sequence steps and use technologies and techniques to safely produce designed solutions."
Technologies,Design and Technologies,Years 5–6,"By the end of Year 6 students explain how people design products, services and environments to meet the needs of communities, including sustainability. For each of the 3 prescribed technologies contexts they explain how the features of technologies impact on design decisions and they create designed solutions. Students select and justify design ideas and solutions against design criteria that include sustainability. They communicate design ideas to an audience using technical terms and graphical representation techniques. Students develop project plans, including production processes, and select technologies and techniques to safely produce designed solutions."
Technologies,Design and Technologies,Years 7–8,"By the end of Year 8 students explain how people design, innovate and produce products, services and environments for preferred futures. For each of the 4 prescribed technologies contexts they explain how the features of technologies impact on design decisions, and create designed solutions based on analysis of needs or opportunities. Students create and adapt design ideas, processes and solutions, and justify their decisions against developed design criteria that include sustainability. They communicate design ideas and solutions to audiences using technical terms and graphical representation techniques, including using digital tools. They independently and collaboratively document and manage production processes to safely produce designed solutions."
Technologies,Design and Technologies,Years 9–10,"By the end of Year 10 students explain how people consider factors that impact on design decisions and the technologies used to design and produce products, services and environments for sustainable living. They explain the contribution of innovation, enterprise skills and emerging technologies to global preferred futures. For one or more of the technologies contexts, students explain the features of technologies and their appropriateness for purpose, and create designed solutions based on an analysis of needs or opportunities. Students create, adapt and refine design ideas, processes and solutions and justify their decisions against developed design criteria that include sustainability. They communicate design ideas, processes and solutions to a range of audiences, including using digital tools. Students independently and collaboratively develop and apply production and project management plans, adjusting processes when necessary. They select and use technologies skilfully and safely to produce designed solutions."
