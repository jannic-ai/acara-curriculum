To understand is to go beyond the information that is presented. It involves knowing at a deeper level, in order to be able to explain and build on the ideas, concepts or skills. Understanding forms the building blocks for more complex levels of thinking, including analysing, evaluating, inferring and predicting. As learners become more proficient at making meaning, they develop mental models using explicitly communicated and implied information. Through the activation of ideas, connections can be made between known and new information to improve learners’ understanding. Using questions such as why and how can help to grasp concepts and build a deeper understanding.

A process of understanding may include:
• identifying and highlighting concepts, key words or phrases
• making connections with new and known information
• recognising and explaining the key message in the information.","Marzano, R & Kendall"
