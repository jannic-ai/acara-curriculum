HASS,Geography,Year 7,"By the end of Year 7, students describe how the characteristics of places are perceived and valued differently by people. They describe the importance of environments to people. They describe the features of a distribution. They explain the interconnections between people and places and environments, and describe how these interconnections change places or environments. Students describe a response or strategy to address a geographical phenomenon or challenge.
Students develop questions about a geographical phenomenon or challenge. They collect, organise and represent relevant data and information, using primary research methods and secondary research materials. They identify similarities and differences, and describe patterns in data and information. They draw conclusions about the impact of the geographical phenomenon or challenge on people, places and environments. They develop a strategy for action. Students use geographical knowledge, concepts, terms and relevant findings from sources to create descriptions, explanations and responses."
HASS,Geography,Year 8,"By the end of Year 8, students explain how the interactions of people and environmental processes impact on the characteristics of places. They explain how the characteristics of places are perceived and valued differently by people. They describe the effects of human activity or hazards on environments. They explain the features of a distribution and identify implications. They explain the interconnections between people and places and environments. They explain how these interconnections change places or environments. Students explain responses or strategies to address a geographical phenomenon or challenge, referring to environmental, economic or social factors.
Students develop relevant questions about a geographical phenomenon or challenge. They collect, organise and represent relevant and reliable data and information, using primary research methods and secondary research materials. They interpret and analyse data and information to explain patterns and trends and infer relationships. They draw reasoned conclusions about the impact of the geographical phenomenon or challenge. They decide on appropriate strategies for action and explain potential impacts. Students use geographical knowledge, methods, concepts, terms and reference findings from sources to create descriptions, explanations and responses."
HASS,Geography,Year 9,"By the end of Year 9, students explain how peoples’ activities or environmental processes change the characteristics of places. They explain the effects of human activity on environments, and the effects of environments on human activity. They explain the features of biomes’ distribution and identify implications for environments. They analyse the interconnections between people and places and environments. They identify and explain how these interconnections influence people, and change places and environments. Students analyse strategies to address a geographical phenomenon or challenge using environmental, social or economic criteria.
Students develop a range of questions about a geographical phenomenon or challenge. They collect, represent and compare relevant and reliable geographical data and information by using a range of primary research methods and secondary research materials in a range of formats. They interpret and analyse data and information to explain patterns and trends and infer relationships. They draw evidence-based conclusions about the impact of the geographical phenomenon or challenge. They develop and evaluate strategies, predict impacts and make a recommendation. Students use geographical knowledge, concepts, terms and digital tools as appropriate to develop descriptions, explanations and responses that acknowledge research findings."
HASS,Geography,Year 10,"By the end of Year 10, students explain how the interactions of people and environmental processes at different scales change the characteristics of places. They explain the effects of human activity on environments, and the effect of environments on human activity, over time. They evaluate the implications of a distribution. They evaluate the extent of interconnections occurring between people and places and environments. They analyse changes that result from these interconnections and their consequences. Students evaluate strategies to address a geographical phenomenon or challenge, using environmental, social and economic criteria.
Students develop a range of relevant questions about a geographical phenomenon or challenge. They collect, represent and compare relevant and reliable geographical data and information by using a range of primary research methods and secondary research materials, using appropriate formats. They interpret and analyse data and information to make generalisations and predictions, explain significant patterns and trends, and infer relationships. They draw evidence-based conclusions, based on relevant data and information, about the impact of the geographical phenomenon or challenge. They develop and evaluate strategies using criteria, recommend a strategy and explain the predicted impacts. Students use geographical knowledge, concepts, terms and digital tools as appropriate to develop descriptions, explanations and responses that synthesise research findings."
